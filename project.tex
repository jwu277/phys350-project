    \subsubsection*{Introduction}
    In this problem we derive an expression for the longitudinal speed of sound in a homogeneous isotropic elastic solid by modelling the solid as a three-dimensional cubic lattice. We first determine the speed of sound in terms of microscopic parameters of the material; subsequently we shall express the speed of sound in macroscopic material properties. For simplicity, we consider the case of a rectangular prism.

    \subsubsection*{Part I}
    Consider a solid rectangular prism of dimensions $a \times b \times c$ at rest. We tie our inertial reference frame to a corner of the prism with axes along those of the prism as shown in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:I1}} (so more precisely, we require this corner to be at rest).
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{images/i1.jpg}
        \caption{Sketch of the solid prism and our inertial reference frame for \textbf{Part I}. The solid is of side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ along the $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes, respectively.}
        \label{fig:I1}
    \end{figure}
    We may model this solid prism as a $M \times N \times P$ cubic lattice of point masses, each with mass $m$. These point masses represent the solid's atoms. This is illustrated in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:I2}}.
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.6\textwidth}
            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/I2.jpg}

            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/I3.jpg}

            \label{fig:I3}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{(a) Sketch of the crystal lattice projected on the $xy$-plane. The black dots represent atoms; each atom in the lattice is spaced out by a distance $l_0$ at equilibrium. In total there are $M$, $N$, and $P$ atoms along the $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes, respectively. Although this is not depicted, this lattice repeats similarly along the $z$-axis. (b) Sketch of the interaction between an interior atom (square) and its six neighbours (circles). This interaction is modelled as a spring of equilibrium length $l_0$ and spring constant $K$. It follows that these springs lie along the $x$-, $y$-, and $z$-axes (two on each).}
    \end{figure}
    The bond potential energy between two adjacent atoms experiences a local minimum at an equilibrium length $l_0$. Applying the small oscillations approximation to this stable equilibrium, we model the interaction between two adjacent atoms as a harmonic oscillator (i.e. spring) of equilibrium displacement $l_0$ and spring constant $K$. Furthermore, we take the interaction between non-adjacent atoms to be negligible. For interior (i.e. not on the solid's boundary) atoms, this is depicted in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:I3}} (as we shall see, the boundary atoms and their interactions with the external environment determine the boundary conditions). Finally, we neglect gravity throughout this problem.\newline\newline
    \textbf{As a bonus challenge, complete all parts of this problem for an arbitrary prismatic solid. That is, take} $P$ \textbf{to be a function of} $j$\textbf{,} $P(j)$\textbf{.}\newline\newline
    To get started, how many degrees of freedom in this system? What set of generalized coordinates could you use to describe this system?

    \subsubsection*{Part II}
    We may label each atom in the lattice with indices $i$, $j$, and $k$. We shall label the corner atom at the origin with $i = 1$, $j = 1$, and $k = 1$. Then our indices range over $1 \leq i \leq M$, $1 \leq j \leq N$, and $1 \leq k \leq P$. The atom adjacent in the $x$-direction to the origin corner atom, for example, would have indices $(i, j, k) = (2, 1, 1)$. Two atoms above this atom in the $z$-direction would have indices $(i, j, k) = (2, 1, 3)$, etc. We may denote the (global i.e. when every atom is at equilibrium) equilibrium $x$, $y$, and $z$ positions of the $(i, j, k)$ atom as $\tilde{x}_{ijk}$, $\tilde{y}_{ijk}$, and $\tilde{z}_{ijk}$, respectively. \newline\newline
    Determine $\tilde{x}_{ijk}$, $\tilde{y}_{ijk}$, and $\tilde{z}_{ijk}$ in terms of $i$, $j$, $k$, and $l_0$. What are the dimensions $a$, $b$, and $c$ of the prism in terms of $M$, $N$, $P$, and $l_0$?

    \subsubsection*{Part III}
    We similarly may denote the (current) $x$, $y$, and $z$ positions of the $(i, j, k)$ particle as $x_{ijk}$, $y_{ijk}$, and $z_{ijk}$, respectively. In terms of these coordinates, find the total kinetic and potential energies of the system. What is the Lagrangian?

    \subsubsection*{Part IV}
    Find the Euler-Lagrange equations for the $(i, j, k)$ interior atom ($2 \leq i \leq M-1$, $2 \leq j \leq N-1$, $2 \leq k \leq P-1$). For simplicity, find the EL equations only for $x_{ijk}$ (the equations for $y_{ijk}$ and $z_{ijk}$ are then determined by symmetry). We will consider the boundary atoms later.

    \subsubsection*{Part V}
    Now let us consider longitudinal acoustic wave (sound) propagation along the $x$-axis. That is, we consider wave propagation where $y_{ijk}$ and $z_{ijk}$ are not displaced from their equilibrium values. For example, we could have a hammer uniformly striking the $yz$ face of the prism opposite to the origin. The longitudinal wave propagation is therefore described by the longitudinal displacement (from equilibrium) $X_{ijk}$ of point $(i, j, k)$: $X_{ijk} = x_{ijk} - \tilde{x}_{ijk}$. We are focusing on the case where external acoustic stimuli are applied uniformly along $j$ and $k$ so that $X_{ijk}$ is constant in $j$ and $k$.\newline\newline
    Simplify the $x$ EL equations, applying the simplification that $y_{ijk}$ and $z_{ijk}$ are not displaced. Rewrite these equations in terms of $X$. Also show that $\ddot{y}_{ijk}$ and $\ddot{z}_{ijk}$ are equal to zero in the EL equations (this ensures that if the system starts with $y_{ijk}$ and $z_{ijk}$ at rest for all $(i, j, k)$, $y_{ijk}$ and $z_{ijk}$ will remain unperturbed).

    \subsubsection*{Part VI}
    Turning now to the theory of finite differences, we may approximate the derivatives of a twice continuously differentiable function $f(x)$ in a mesh as
    $$\deriv{f}{x}\bigg|_{x=x_i} \approx \frac{f(x_{i+1}) - f(x_i)}{\Delta x}, \; \nderiv{f}{x}{2}\bigg|_{x=x_i} \approx \frac{f(x_{i+1}) + f(x_{i-1}) - 2f(x_i)}{\left(\Delta x\right)^2}$$
    for a given mesh size of $\Delta x$. We will make use of the first approximation later. Of course, these finite differences have analogous formulae for partial derivatives.\newline\newline
    Let us now concern ourselves with somehow differentiating $X_{ijk}$. As it stands, this is not a function of $x$, $y$, and $z$, which we would like it to be. But notice that in analyzing a macroscopic solid, $M$, $N$, and $P$ are very large. Taking inspiration from fluid mechanics, however, we then define a cubic volume element to be small enough so that the prism can be decomposed into a large number of such elements, yet large enough to contain a large number of atoms. Then we can define a function $\tilde{X}(x, y, z, t)$ to be the average value of $X(t)$ for all the point masses inside the cubic volume element (whose sides run along the coordinate axes) centred at the point $(x, y, z)$.\newline\newline
    Observe that the EL equations for $X$ can be massaged into a finite set of finite difference equations for $\tilde{X}(x, y, z, t)$. Perform this manipulation.

    \subsubsection*{Part VII}
    As one of the most important equations in physics, the wave equation is
    $$\npderiv{f}{t}{2} = c^2 \nabla^2 f$$
    This represents the propagation of a quantity $f$ through space. The constant $c$ is known as the \textit{wave speed}; this represents the speed at which $f$ propagates through space. Notice that the set of equations obtained in \textbf{Part VI} is a \textit{pseudo}-discretization of the wave equation for $\tilde{X}$. \newline\newline
    ``Undiscretize'' these equations to recover the wave equation for $\tilde{X}$. Longitudinal sound wave in a solid are hence carried through $\tilde{X}$, the local average longitudinal displacement. Find the wave speed $c$ in terms of the quantities we have encountered thus far. The equations in \textbf{Part VI} represent a \textit{pseudo}-discretization of the wave equation; in fact, this is better than a typical finite difference discretization. Why is this the case (recall that finite difference discretizations are used to numerically compute the solutions to differential equations)?

    \subsubsection*{Part VIII}
    Let us take a detour now to the mechanics of materials. Consider a uniaxial deformation of the prism where the $yz$-face opposite to the origin is displaced by an amount $\delta$. In terms of generalized coordinates, we now constrain $x_{Mjk} = a + \delta$ for all $1 \leq j \leq N, 1 \leq k \leq P$ under the deformation. If initially the system was at rest (with no constraint on $x_{Mjk}$), and we take the system after the displacement to be at rest (this could be in steady state, where the oscillations of the atoms have been damped; for sound propagation we have neglected damping), then the \textit{elastic modulus} $E$ is defined to be the constant of proportionality such that the increase in energy per total (initial) volume is $\frac{1}{2}E\varepsilon^2$, where $\varepsilon = \frac{\delta}{a}$ is known as the \textit{strain} of the deformation (the elastic modulus is more commonly defined in terms of forces; in the context of Lagrangian mechanics, however, we shall continue to formulate phenomena in terms of generalized coordinates and energies). Finally, the density $\rho$ of a material is its mass per unit volume.\newline\newline
    Express the speed of sound $c$ in the solid in terms of its macroscopic properties.

    \subsubsection*{Part IX}
    We have finally found the speed of longitudinal sound waves in a homogeneous isotropic elastic solid, albeit for the case of a rectangular prism. Our results, however, apply to any such prismatic solid. TODO: finish + update I2 fig
